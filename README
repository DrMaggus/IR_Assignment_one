** Concept and approach **
First we got a general idea of the project. We asked question like:
What are we suppose to do?
What are the libraries we ought to use?
How do we manage the distribution of the tasks?

After this short overview we came up with the following:
Markus => xml parsing
Matthias => range queries 
Julien => normal queries and general overview of lucene

After everybody had worked on his own tasks we came together and
joined everything together (main-function).

You can find the source code in this folder:
/src/main/java
and then in the respective package (folder).

Maybe you want to integrate the project in eclipse,
to get a better overview of it.
Just go to eclipse => File => Import => Existing project => select folder 'source/poweryoga'

The "Reuters-xml file" is located in /src/main/resources


** RUN PROGRAM **

1. Extract the IR13_Assignment_PowerYoga.tar.gz to a desired path.
2. Change directory to <desired_path>/IR12_Assignment_PowerYoga
3. In this directory you'll find a .jar file.
4. Execute it by typing in 

	java -jar IR13_Assignment_PowerYoga.jar
	
into your console.
